# Tic-Tac-Toe Predictor 

## Goal
Design a Tic-Tac-Toe solver capable of predicting the outcome of a specific game when a board is provided, assuming both players are playing optimally. 

## Program 
The program takes as input an array of size 9 (indices 0-8 representing the blocks) and a number representing which player plays next (1 for "X" and 2 for "O").

The array contains 0 for empty squares on the board, 1 for "X" and 2 for "O".
